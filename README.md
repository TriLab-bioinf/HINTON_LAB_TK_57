### How to run alphafold2.sh

```
alphafold2.sh prefix_file output_dir_name
```

Where prefix_file is a list with protein IDs, one per row that should match the prefix of the fasta files containing each of the protein sequences, and output_dir_name is the name of the output directory where results will be stored. If the directory is not present the script will create one.
